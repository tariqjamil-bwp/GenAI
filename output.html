<p><strong>Literature Review: LLM Agents in Education</strong></p>

<p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education has gained significant attention in recent years. One of the potential applications of LLMs in education is the use of LLM agents to simulate classroom environments (Simulating Classroom Education with LLM-Empowered Agents, 2024). This can be particularly useful for generating educational content (Educational content generation using multi-LLM agents, 2024). Additionally, LLMs can be used to provide instant feedback to students, making it easier for them to get feedback (How LLM Can Transform Education, 2024).</p>

<p><strong>Simulating Classroom Education with LLM-Empowered Agents (2024)</strong>
This paper explores the potential of using LLM agents to simulate classroom environments. The authors propose a framework for creating virtual classrooms using LLMs, which can provide a more immersive and interactive learning experience for students. The paper highlights the benefits of using LLM agents in education, including increased accessibility and personalization.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper introduces a novel approach to simulating classroom education using LLM-empowered agents. Our framework leverages the capabilities of LLMs to create virtual classrooms that can provide a more immersive and interactive learning experience for students.</p>

<p><strong>Body:</strong> The authors discuss the potential benefits of using LLM agents in education, including increased accessibility and personalization. They also propose a framework for creating virtual classrooms using LLMs, which can provide a more immersive and interactive learning experience for students.</p>
