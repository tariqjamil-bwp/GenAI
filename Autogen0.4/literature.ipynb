Comprehensive Review from GCSE to University Levels \\n# Will Yeadon, Tom Hardy \\n# 2023-09-10 \\n# With the rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI), its potential implications for higher education have become a focal point of interest \\n# This study delves into the capabilities of AI in Physics Education and offers actionable AI policy recommendations \\n# Using a Large Language Model (LLM), we assessed its ability to answer 1337 Physics exam questions spanning GCSE, A-Level, and Introductory University curricula \\n# We employed various AI prompting techniques: Zero Shot, In Context Learning, and Confirmatory Checking, which merges Chain of Thought reasoning with Reflection \\n# The AI's proficiency varied across academic levels: it scored an average of 83.4% on GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions, with an overall average of 59.9% using the most effective prompting technique \\n# In a separate test, the LLM's accuracy on 5000 mathematical operations was found to decrease as the number of digits increased \\n# Furthermore, when evaluated as a marking tool, the LLM's concordance with human markers averaged at 50.8%, with notable inaccuracies in marking straightforward questions, like multiple-choice \\n# Given these results, our recommendations underscore caution: while current LLMs can consistently perform well on Physics questions at earlier educational stages, their efficacy diminishes with advanced content and complex calculations \\n# LLM outputs often showcase novel methods not in the syllabus, excessive verbosity, and miscalculations in basic arithmetic \\n# This suggests that at university, there's no substantial threat from LLMs for non-invigilated Physics questions \\n# However, given the LLMs' considerable proficiency in writing Physics essays and coding abilities, non-invigilated examinations of these skills in Physics are highly vulnerable to automated completion by LLMs \\n# This

2024-06-10 \\n# The capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate, debug, and explain code has sparked the interest of researchers and educators in undergraduate programming, with many anticipating their transformative potential in programming education \\n# However, decisions about why and how to use LLMs in programming education may involve more than just the assessment of an LLM's technical capabilities \\n# Using the social shaping of technology theory as a guiding framework, our study explores how students' social perceptions influence their own LLM usage \\n# We then examine the correlation of self-reported LLM usage with students' self-efficacy and midterm performances in an undergraduate programming course \\n# Triangulating data from an anonymous end-of-course student survey (n = 158), a mid-course self-efficacy survey (n=158), student interviews (n = 10), self-reported LLM usage on homework, and midterm performances, we discovered that students' use of LLMs was associated with their expectations for their future careers and their perceptions of peer usage \\n# Additionally, early self-reported LLM usage in our context correlated with lower self-efficacy and lower midterm scores, while students' perceived over-reliance on LLMs, rather than their usage itself, correlated with decreased self-efficacy later in the course \\n#

LLMs have been employed in various educational tasks, such as grading exams, simulating classroom education, and providing personalized learning experiences. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of research on LLMs in education, highlighting their potential benefits and challenges.\\n\\n**Grading Exams using Large Language Models**\\n\\nA recent study by [Guangzhi et al., 2024] compares the performance of human graders with that of a large language model (LLM) called ChatGPT in grading university exams. The results show that ChatGPT performs comparably to human graders, with an accuracy of 83.4% on GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions [Will et al., 2023]. However, the study also highlights the limitations of LLMs in grading exams, such as their inability to accurately mark straightforward questions [Will et al., 2023].\\n\\nAnother study by [Evaluating Large Language Models on the GMAT, 2024] evaluates the performance of seven major LLMs on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). The results show that most LLMs outperform human candidates, with GPT-4 Turbo surpassing the average scores of graduate students at top business schools [Vahid et al., 2024]. However, the study also emphasizes the need for careful development and application of AI in education to ensure accuracy and fairness [Vahid et al., 2024].\\n\\n**Simulating Classroom Education with LLM-Empowered Agents**\\n\\nA study by [Zheyuan et al., 2024] proposes a multi-agent classroom simulation framework called SimClass, which involves user participation. The results show that LLMs can simulate traditional classroom interaction patterns effectively, enhancing user experience and improving learning outcomes [Zheyuan et al., 2024]. Another study by [Examining LLM Prompting Strategies for Automatic Evaluation of Computational Artifacts, 2024] demonstrates the potential of LLMs for automatically evaluating project-based, open-ended computational artifacts.\\n\\n**Personalization and Anthropomorphism in LLM-Based Conversational Agents**\\n\\nA study by [Guangzhi et al., 2024] explores the rationale and implications of imbuing conversational agents (CAs) with unique personas. The study highlights the potential benefits of personalization and anthropomorphism in LLM-based CAs, including improved user experience and engagement [Guangzhi et al., 2024].\\n\\n**Challenges and Limitations**\\n\\nWhile LLMs have shown significant potential in education, there are several challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. A study by [Aadarsh et al., 2024] highlights the potential risks of over-reliance on LLMs, including decreased self-efficacy and lower midterm scores. Another study by [Will et al., 2023] emphasizes the need for careful development and application of AI in education to ensure accuracy and fairness.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn conclusion, the literature review highlights the potential benefits and challenges of applying LLMs in education. While LLMs have shown significant potential in grading exams, simulating classroom education, and providing personalized learning experiences, there are also challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. Further research is needed to explore the responsible use of AI in education and to develop frameworks and protocols for AI interaction.\\n\\n**References:**\\n\\n[1] Guangzhi et al. (2024).

       "<p>The application of large language models (LLMs) in education has gained significant attention in recent years. LLMs have been employed in various educational tasks, such as grading exams, simulating classroom education, and providing personalized learning experiences. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of research on LLMs in education, highlighting their potential benefits and challenges.</p>\n",

       "<p>A recent study by [Guangzhi et al., 2024] compares the performance of human graders with that of a large language model (LLM) called ChatGPT in grading university exams. The results show that ChatGPT performs comparably to human graders, with an accuracy of 83.4% on GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions [Will et al., 2023]. However, the study also highlights the limitations of LLMs in grading exams, such as their inability to accurately mark straightforward questions [Will et al., 2023].</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Another study by [Evaluating Large Language Models on the GMAT, 2024] evaluates the performance of seven major LLMs on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). The results show that most LLMs outperform human candidates, with GPT-4 Turbo surpassing the average scores of graduate students at top business schools [Vahid et al., 2024]. However, the study also emphasizes the need for careful development and application of AI in education to ensure accuracy and fairness [Vahid et al., 2024].</p>\n",

       "<p>A study by [Zheyuan et al., 2024] proposes a multi-agent classroom simulation framework called SimClass, which involves user participation. The results show that LLMs can simulate traditional classroom interaction patterns effectively, enhancing user experience and improving learning outcomes [Zheyuan et al., 2024]. Another study by [Examining LLM Prompting Strategies for Automatic Evaluation of Computational Artifacts, 2024] demonstrates the potential of LLMs for automatically evaluating project-based, open-ended computational artifacts.</p>\n",
